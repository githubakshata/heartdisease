# ❤️ Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

This project predicts the likelihood of heart disease in patients using machine learning models trained on medical data. Developed as an individual final year project by a student of **Srinivas University, Mukkamangalore – Department of Computer Science**, it showcases how ML can assist in early diagnosis in the healthcare domain.

## 🚀 Key Features

- ✅ Predicts risk of heart disease from user inputs
- 📊 Based on the UCI Heart Disease dataset
- 🧠 Implements multiple ML models for comparison
- 📈 Data preprocessing, visualization, and evaluation
- 🖥️ Can be extended into a web app using Streamlit or Flask

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas & NumPy – for data manipulation
- Scikit-learn – ML model building & evaluation
- Matplotlib & Seaborn – for data visualization
- Jupyter Notebook – for development and testing

## 💡 Input Features

The model uses the following features for prediction:

- Age
- Sex (1 = male; 0 = female)
- Chest Pain Type (4 values)
- Resting Blood Pressure
- Serum Cholesterol
- Fasting Blood Sugar
- Resting ECG Results
- Max Heart Rate Achieved
- Exercise-Induced Angina
- ST Depression
- Slope of the ST Segment
- Number of Major Vessels (0–3)
- Thalassemia
